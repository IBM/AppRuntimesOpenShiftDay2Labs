# App Runtimes OpenShift Day 2 Labs

Welcome to the App Runtimes OpenShift Day 2 Labs. These labs will help familiarize you with OpenShift, Kubernetes, containers, and common "Day 2" operations and problem determination for WebSphere Liberty deployments.

The phrase “Day 2" refers to ongoing operations and maintenance of deployed applications whereas “Day 1” refers to installation, configuration, and application deployment.

There are a total of 9 labs that may be performed in sequence or independently as you prefer. Use the table of contents to choose a particular lab or click Next below to start all of the labs.

## Pre-requisites

1. If you're running Windows, ensure you've installed [`curl`](https://curl.se/windows/) and [`jq`](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/download/), or use a [`Cygwin`](https://www.cygwin.com/) shell instead of a command prompt.
1. If you are using your own OpenShift cluster, review [OpenShift Cluster Preparation](lab_administration.md#openshift-cluster-preparation)
1. If you do not have access to an OpenShift cluster:
    1. Speak with your IBM account team and they can raise a request through the IBM-internal link <https://ibm.biz/app-platform-swat-team-request>
    1. Otherwise, if your laptop is x86_64/amd64 and has at least [4 free CPUs and 9GB of free RAM](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openshift_local/2.16/html/getting_started_guide/installation_gsg#for_openshift_container_platform), you can install [Red Hat OpenShift Local](https://developers.redhat.com/products/openshift-local/overview) and then review [OpenShift Cluster Preparation](lab_administration.md#openshift-cluster-preparation)
